The most common case is that each interface volume is defined by the same CV, with different maximum values of the CV, but the same minimum value. However, it is also possible to have interface sets where both minimum and maximum value are changing (the value of $\\lambda$ is not uniquely defined by inspecting the `Volume` objects) or where the interfaces don't all grow in terms of a single common CV.\n",

    "## Multiple State Outer Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main improvement in this module is the development of a better approach to handle the multiple state outer interface. The MS-outer interface itself is a somewhat confusing object; the previous input setup was even more confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's remember the distinction between an interface and an ensemble. An interface is a volume of points in phase space, whereas an ensemble is a set of rules that define whether a trajectory is in or out of the ensemble. Most ensembles in TIS must begin in a specific initial ensemble. However, the MS-outer ensemble allows the trajectory to begin in any of several states. It is easiest to think of the MS-outer ensemble as the set-theoretic union of MSTIS ensembles associated with several initial states. This means that the \"interface\" is actually several volumes, which must later be associated with the combined ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, the MS-outer interface was created by implicitly assuming that certain interfaces given by the user were intended to be turned into an MS-outer interface. This could lead to confusion when one of the user's ensembles \"disappeared.\" Worse, the MS-outer interface was only created under certain specific conditions, leading in inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, although the MS-outer ensemble can be used to facilitate replica exchange between different interface sets, the better way of doing that is with a state-swap move. The changes in this module make the MS-outer interface optional, so that it can easily be replaced by the state-swap move."
